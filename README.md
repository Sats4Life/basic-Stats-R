# basic-Stats-R
Step by step tutorials to run basic statistics (descriptive and inferential) in R using RStudio

These three tutorials were developed as part of a first year Life Sciences university course. Each is developed around a case study or example to help students understand how to apply the different statistical concepts and tests in their respective fields. The examples are illustrative and not exhaustive. Data were created in R.
The tutorials cover the following:
T0: basic R
T1: Descriptive stats
T2: Data screening and Differences between two groups (parametric and non-parametric)
T3: Differences between three groups (parametric and non-parametric, including post-hoc tests)
